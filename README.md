# python-practice

A personal repository of bite-sized Python exercises demonstrating core programming concepts through standalone scripts.

Additional exercises will be added over time.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed

## Running an Exercise

       cd 01_greet  

2. Run the script  
       
       python3 greet.py  

Replace `01_greet` and `greet.py` with the folder and script you wish to run.
